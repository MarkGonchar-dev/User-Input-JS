            More questions lie in looking at the influence of genetics on brain and language development.
            Are there genes that mutated and gave us language ability?
            Researchers have found a gene mutation that occurred between 200,000 and 100,000 years ago,
            which seems to have a connection with speaking and how our brains control our mouths and face.
            Monkeys have a similar gene, but it did not undergo this mutation.
            It's too early to say how much influence genes have on language, but one day the answers might be found in our DNA.
